# Express-Demo

Express-Demo project contains few examples on RESTful Services/RESTful api's. I created very commonly used APIs for web-based applications here.

Express.js is a modular web framework for Node.js. It is used for easier creation of web applications and services. Express.js simplifies development and makes it easier to write secure, modular and fast applications.

It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.
